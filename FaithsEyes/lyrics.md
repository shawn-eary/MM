# Faith's Eyes Lyrics

#### Verse1
What do I need more \
than anything else? \
Than a Heart full of joy to \
recuse my health \
Where to find beauty to \
set  me free \
I have a daughter that's a sight to see 

#### Chorus
Faith's  Eye-Eye-Eye-S \
clear and forgiving full of light \
Faith's  Eye-Eye-Eye-S \
joy and peace glowing so bright \
If's anything I need and anything I want \
I just wanna a see the world \
through Faith's Eyes 

#### Verse2
Down at the square here in Bentonville \
just me and Faith at the station grill \
She danced in a park before we sat down \
And then through her eyes her mother came out 

#### Bridge
Sparkling beauty joy and style \
eyes that show a spiritual smile \
love and compassion is what I see \
gentle eyes to bring a man to his knees
