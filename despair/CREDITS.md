You will need a Roland Juno-DS to use any of these files. I don't expect you to have Cubase, but you should be able to import the MIDI or OMF into the DAW of your choice. Maybe when I get the MIDI sorted out, I might switch to Ardour on GNU\Linux I'm not sure. It's just that I'm more familiar with Cubase and right now there really isn't much to show.

Right now, I can't seem to get the 16 channel Juno DS MIDI to come out to the audio stream so I'm sending analog output to an MAudio Delta 1010 for recording/monitoring. This would ultimately give me the option of mixing in other sources later anyway even if this is supposed to be Juno DS only project.

There ain't much here yet. I'm still trying to figure out setup. For some reason I have to manually put the Juno DS in 16 channel performance mode because I can't figure out the correct MIDI or Sysex to send. Fortunately, the instruments are getting remembered.

I am a Christian but this is not a Christian piece. As Google might say, don't be evil. I'm just getting started. You will need a Juno-DS to render this project.
